# 8086-microprocessor-emulator

A Python-based emulator simulating the **Intel 8086 microprocessor**, complete with GUI, assembler-level support, and real-time memory/register visualization. Built as an educational tool to understand low-level architecture, this project mimics the behavior of registers, flags, instructions, and stack operations â€” all in a user-friendly interface.

---

## Features

-  Emulation of 8086 registers (AX, BX, CX, DX, etc.)
-  Status flags: ZF, CF, SF, OF, PF
-  1MB Simulated Memory and Stack Support
-  40+ Assembly Instructions: `MOV`, `ADD`, `MUL`, `CALL`, `RET`, `LOOP`, `SHL`, `JMP`, etc.
-  Conditionals: `JE`, `JNE`, `JC`, `JNC`, etc.
-  Loops: `LOOP`, `LOOPE`, `LOOPNE`
-  GUI built with Tkinter for code input/output
-  Displays real-time register/memory updates
